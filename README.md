Some of the Frontend Mentor challenges I have been doing. <br>
The great benefit of Frontend Mentor challenges is that you don't have to wait for inspiration to start building something, you can just grab the files, images and designs from their website and start coding. <br>
The designs they came up with are modern and pretty looking, it's a pleasure to make them.
